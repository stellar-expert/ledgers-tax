# LedgersTax

> Export your Stellar transactions history for tax reporting. Even on the moon, you still have to file taxes.

We plan to provide tax reports in formats compatible with Koinly, BitcoinTax, Recap, Cryptotax, Awaken, CoinLedger, CoinPanda, KoinX, TurboTax, and other tax reporting software.
